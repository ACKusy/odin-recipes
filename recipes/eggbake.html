        <h3><strong>It takes very little work, so it is worth it.</strong></h3>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds pork sausage</li>
            <li>12 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>4 green onions</li>
            <li>1/2 green pepper, diced</li>
            <li>1/2 red bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</p>
        <p>Spray a 9x13" pan with cooking spray.</p>
        <p>Combine the eggs, sour cream, milk, cheese and salt and pepper in a large bowl. Mix on low speed with electric mixers, just until combined.</p>
        <p>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add sausage and cook until browned, breaking it into small pieces with a wooden spoon as it cooks. Drain most of the grease and add the sausage to the bowl with the egg mixture.</p>
        <p>Add the bell peppers and onion to the same skillet the sausage was cooked in and sauté for 2- 3 minutes. Add to the bowl with the eggs and stir everything to combine.</p>
        <p>Pour mixture into greased 9x13’’ pan and bake for 35-50 minutes or until the edges are set and the center is just barely jiggly.</p>
        <p>Leftover egg casserole can be stored in the fridge and enjoyed within 3-4 days. Leftovers are delicious reheated in the microwave. </p>
